# Sushi Go! Rules PDF

The Sushi Go! rules PDF should be placed in this directory as `SushiGoTM-RULES.pdf`.

## Instructions Link

The game UI includes an "📖 Instructions" link on both the login and playing screens that opens the rules PDF in a new tab.

## How to obtain the PDF:

Download the official rules PDF from:
https://aadl.org/files/catalog_guides/SushiGoTM-RULES.pdf

Alternatively, if the above link is not accessible, you can download from these sources:
- https://fgbradleys.com/wp-content/uploads/rules/SushiGo-rules.pdf
- https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/e5/92/74-sushi-go-rulebook.pdf

Save the downloaded file as `SushiGoTM-RULES.pdf` in the `test-frontend` directory.

## Note

Due to network restrictions in the automated build environment, the PDF cannot be downloaded automatically and must be added manually to the repository. Once added, the "Instructions" link in the UI will open the PDF file.
